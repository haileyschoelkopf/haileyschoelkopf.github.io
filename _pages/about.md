Hi! I'm Hailey (she/her). I am currently a Research Scientist at [EleutherAI](https://eleuther.ai). There, I study a variety of things AI, ML, and LLMs, but some of my research interests in particular include: 

- Rigorous, reliable evaluation of LLMs and other generative models: how do we create standards for reproducible evaluation of AI models, evaluate them on complex tasks, and build a science of capability testing?
- The engineering that goes into distributed training and making it fast. 
- The science of scaling models up reliably.


I am currently a maintainer of the [LM Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness). Other notable projects include pretraining the [Pythia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01373) suite of language models, and engineering for the continually-pretrained [Llemma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10631) base models for mathematics.
