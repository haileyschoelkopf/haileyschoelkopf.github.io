I gave an ICML 2024 tutorial with Lintang Sutawika on "Challenges in LM Evaluation"! For ICML attendees, the recording can be found [on the ICML website](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/tutorial/35227) and the slides are uploaded [here](https://github.com/lm-evaluation-challenges/lm-evaluation-challenges.github.io/blob/main/%5BMain%5D%20ICML%20Tutorial%202024%20-%20Challenges%20in%20LM%20Evaluation.pdf). Thank you to all who attended!
